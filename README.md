# Astro + Decap CMS + Cloudflare Template

A starter template for building a static site with [Astro](https://astro.build) and managing its content with [Decap CMS](https://decapcms.org/), all deployed on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). This setup includes a Cloudflare Worker acting as a custom GitHub OAuth proxy, allowing you to authenticate via GitHub without relying on Netlify Identity or Git Gateway. Additionally, you can optionally use [Cloudflare Zero Trust (Access)](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/access/) to add an extra layer of security to your `/admin` page.

## Features

- **Astro** for building fast, content-focused static sites.
- **Decap CMS** for an editor-friendly content management UI.
- **Cloudflare Pages** for fast, globally-distributed static hosting.
- **Cloudflare Worker (OAuth Proxy)** for handling GitHub OAuth without external services.
- **GitHub Backend** for storing and versioning content as Markdown files directly in your repo.
- **(Optional) Cloudflare Zero Trust** for restricting access to the `/admin` interface to authorized users only.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js and npm** installed locally.
- A **GitHub account** with a repository set up for your siteâ€™s content.
- A **Cloudflare account** with a domain configured (optional but recommended for custom domains).
- A **GitHub OAuth application** for authentication.

### Manual Setup

Follow these steps to manually set up each component of the stack.

#### 1. Create an Astro Project

##### a. Initialize the Project

1. **Install Node.js and npm**
   Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine. Verify installation:

   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

2. **Create a New Astro Project**

   ```bash
   npm create astro@latest my-astro-site
   cd my-astro-site

   ```

3. **Build the Project as Desired**

   Customize your Astro project by adding pages, components, styles, and other assets.

   - **Example:** Create a simple homepage by editing `src/pages/index.astro`:
     ```astro
     ---
     title: "Home"
     ---
     <html>
       <head>
         <title>{title}</title>
       </head>
       <body>
         <h1>Welcome to My Astro Site</h1>
       </body>
     </html>
     ```

4. **Test the Project Locally**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4321` to view your site.

#### 2. Include Decap CMS in the Project

##### a. Integrate Decap CMS

1. **Add Decap CMS Configuration**

   - **Create the Admin Directory:**

     ```bash
     mkdir -p public/admin
     ```

   - **Create `config.yml`:**
     In `public/admin/`, create a file named `config.yml` with the following content. Replace placeholders with your actual GitHub repository details.

     ```yaml
     backend:
       name: github
       repo: "your-username/your-repo" # Replace with your GitHub username/repo
       branch: main
       base_url: "https://decap.your-domain.com" # This subdomainis for the OAuth proxy
       auth_endpoint: "auth" # Default path for authentication

     site_url: "https://your-domain.com"

     media_folder: "public/images/uploads"
     public_folder: "/images/uploads"

     collections:
       - name: "pages"
         label: "Pages"
         folder: "src/pages"
         create: true
         slug: "{{slug}}"
         fields:
           - { label: "Title", name: "title", widget: "string" }
           - { label: "Body", name: "body", widget: "markdown" }
     ```

2. **Add Decap CMS Interface**

   - **Create `index.html`:**

     In `public/admin/`, create an `index.html` file with the following content:

     ```html
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html>
       <head>
         <meta charset="utf-8" />
         <meta
           name="viewport"
           content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"
         />
         <title>Content Manager</title>
       </head>
       <body>
         <!-- Include the Decap CMS script -->
         <script src="https://unpkg.com/decap-cms@latest/dist/decap-cms.js"></script>
       </body>
     </html>
     ```

3. **Verify Decap CMS Integration**

   - **Run the Development Server:**
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
   - **Access the CMS Interface:**
     Navigate to `http://localhost:4321/admin` in your browser. You should see the Decap CMS interface with the "Login with GitHub" button.

#### 3. GitHub OAuth Setup

##### a. Create a GitHub OAuth Application

1. **Navigate to GitHub Developer Settings**

   - Go to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers).

2. **Register a New OAuth App**

   - Click on **"New OAuth App"**.

   - **Fill in the Application Details:**
     - **Application name:** `Decap CMS OAuth Proxy` (or any name you prefer).
     - **Homepage URL:** `https://your-domain.com` (your main site).
     - **Authorization callback URL:** `https://decap.your-domain.com/callback` (the subdomain specifically for the OAuth proxy).

3. **Save the OAuth App**
   - Click **"Register application"**.
   - **Note the Client ID and Client Secret:**
     You can save these to `decap-proxy/.env` file for local development.
     You'll need these credentials later when configuring the Cloudflare Worker.

#### 4. Configure the decap-proxy worker

- This is intended to operate on a subdomain of your domain. eg `decap.your-domain.com`

##### a. Clone and Set Up the Repository

1. **Clone the decap-proxy Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sterlingwes/decap-proxy.git
   cd decap-proxy
   cp wrangler.toml.sample wrangler.toml
   ```

2. **Configure `decap-proxy/wrangler.toml`**

   - **Edit `decap-proxy/wrangler.toml`:**  
     Open `decap-proxy/wrangler.toml` in your preferred editor and make the following changes:

     ```toml
     name = "decap-proxy"
     main = "src/index.ts"
     compatibility_date = "2024-04-19"  # Update as needed
     compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]

     workers_dev = false
     route = { pattern = "decap.your-domain.com", zone_name = "your-domain.com" } # Replace with your domain
     ```

     - **Explanation:**
       - `workers_dev = false`: Disables the default `workers.dev` subdomain.
       - `route`:
         - `pattern`: The subdomain where the OAuth proxy will be accessible (e.g., `decap.your-domain.com`).
         - `zone_name`: Your main domain managed in Cloudflare (e.g., `your-domain.com`).

   - **Ensure the Worker Requests the Correct Scopes:**  
     If your repository is private, you need to request the `repo` scope. This allows Decap CMS to access and modify private repositories.

     In your `decap-proxy/src/index.ts` file, line 30,you can see the `scope` parameter is set to `'public_repo,user'`. This is the default scope for public repositories.

     ```typescript
     const authorizationUri = oauth2.authorizeURL({
       redirect_uri: `https://${url.hostname}/callback?provider=github`,
       scope: "public_repo,user", // change this to 'repo' if your repository is private
       state: randomBytes(4).toString("hex"),
     });
     ```

##### b. Deploy the Worker

While still in the `decap-proxy` directory, deploy the worker to Cloudflare.

1. **Login to Cloudflare via Wrangler**

   ```bash
   npx wrangler login
   ```

   - This command will open a browser window prompting you to authenticate with Cloudflare.

2. **Deploy the Worker**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

##### c. Add Environment Variables to the Worker in Cloudflare

1. **Navigate to the Cloudflare Dashboard**

   - Go to [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/).

2. **Access Workers Settings**

   - Click on **"Workers & Pages"** in the sidebar.
   - Select **"Workers"** and then choose your deployed worker (`decap-proxy`).

3. **Add Environment Variables**

   - Go to **"Settings"** > **"Variables"**.
   - Under **"Environment Variables"**, add the following **Secret Variables**:
     - **`GITHUB_OAUTH_ID`**: Your GitHub OAuth application's Client ID.
     - **`GITHUB_OAUTH_SECRET`**: Your GitHub OAuth application's Client Secret.

4. **Save the Variables**
   - Ensure both variables are saved correctly as secrets.

#### 5. Cloudflare Zero Trust Setup

##### a. Secure the `/admin` Page

1. **Navigate to Cloudflare Zero Trust Dashboard**

   - Go to [Cloudflare Zero Trust](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) dashboard.

2. **Set Up an Access Policy**

   - **Go to "Access" > "Applications":**

     - Click on **"Add an application"**.

   - **Choose "Self-hosted":**

     - Select **"Self-hosted"** as the application type.

   - **Configure Application Settings:**

     - **Application Name:** `Decap CMS` (or any name you prefer).
     - **Application Domain:** `https://your-domain.com/admin/*`
       - This ensures that any access to the `/admin` path is protected.
     - **Session Duration:** Choose as per your preference (e.g., 1 hour).

   - **Set Up Access Policies:**

     - **Policy Name:** `Allow Only Team Members`
     - **Action:** `Allow`
     - **Include:**
       - **Email Domains:** e.g., `@yourcompany.com` to restrict access to specific email domains.
       - **Individuals or Groups:** Specify individual emails or Cloudflare Access groups.
     - **Exclude:** (Optional) Define any exclusions if needed.

   - **Save the Application**
     - Review the settings and click **"Save"**.

#### 6. Cloudflare Pages Setup

##### a. Deploy Your Astro Site to Cloudflare Pages

1. **Push Your Astro Project to GitHub**

   - Initialize a Git repository if you haven't already:
     ```bash
     git init
     git add .
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     git branch -M main
     git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git  # Replace with your repo URL
     git push -u origin main
     ```

2. **Connect to Cloudflare Pages**

   - **Navigate to Cloudflare Dashboard:**

     - Go to [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/).

     - **Connect to Git Provider:**  
       Select GitHub and authorize Cloudflare to access your repositories.
     - **Select Repository:**  
       Choose your `your-username/your-repo` repository.

3. **Configure Build Settings**

   - **Framework Preset:**  
     Select **Astro** if available. If not, choose **None**.

   - **Build Command:**

     ```bash
     npm run build
     ```

   - **Build Output Directory:**
     ```bash
     dist
     ```
     - Astro outputs built files to the `dist` directory by default.

4. **Set Environment Variables (If Needed)**

   - If your Astro project requires environment variables (e.g., API keys), set them in the Cloudflare Pages project settings under **"Environment Variables"**.

5. **Deploy the Project**

   - Click **"Save and Deploy"**.
   - **Monitor the Build Process:**
     - Cloudflare Pages will automatically build and deploy your site. Monitor the deployment logs for any issues.

6. **Configure Custom Domain (Optional but Recommended)**

   - **Add a Custom Domain:**
     - After deployment, navigate to your Pages project settings.
     - Click **"Add Custom Domain"** and follow the prompts to link `https://your-domain.com` to your Cloudflare Pages site.
   - **Update DNS Records:**
     - Ensure that your domain's DNS settings in Cloudflare point to the correct Cloudflare Pages endpoints.

7. **Verify Deployment**
   - Visit `https://your-domain.com` to ensure your site is live.
   - Navigate to `https://your-domain.com/admin` to access the Decap CMS interface (now secured by Cloudflare Zero Trust).

#### 7. Final Adjustments and Testing

##### a. Update `config.yml` with OAuth Proxy Details

1. **Open `public/admin/config.yml`**

   - Ensure the `backend` section includes the correct `base_url` and `auth_endpoint`:

     ```yaml
     backend:
       name: github
       repo: "your-username/your-repo" # Your GitHub username/repo
       branch: main
       base_url: "https://decap.your-domain.com" # Your OAuth proxy domain
       auth_endpoint: "auth" # Path to the auth endpoint

     site_url: "https://your-domain.com"

     media_folder: "public/images/uploads"
     public_folder: "/images/uploads"

     collections:
       - name: "pages"
         label: "Pages"
         folder: "src/pages"
         create: true
         slug: "{{slug}}"
         fields:
           - { label: "Title", name: "title", widget: "string" }
           - { label: "Body", name: "body", widget: "markdown" }
     ```

##### b. Ensure OAuth Proxy Requests Correct Scopes

1. **Verify OAuth Proxy Scope**

   - Since your repository is private, ensure that the OAuth flow requests the `repo` scope. This is handled in your `oauth.ts` by setting the `scope` parameter to `'repo'`.

   - **In `decap-proxy/src/index.ts`:**
     ```typescript
     const authorizationUri = oauth2.authorizeURL({
       redirect_uri: `https://${url.hostname}/callback?provider=github`,
       scope: "repo", // Ensure 'repo' scope for private repos
       state: randomBytes(4).toString("hex"),
     });
     ```

2. **Redeploy the Worker After Changes**
   - If you made changes to the worker code, deploy the worker again:
     ```bash
     npm run deploy
     ```

##### c. Test the Complete Authentication Flow

1. **Access the CMS Interface**

   - Navigate to `https://your-domain.com/admin` in your browser.
   - **Cloudflare Zero Trust:**
     - You should be prompted by Cloudflare Access to authenticate (e.g., via SSO, email, etc.).
     - Only authorized users can proceed.

2. **Initiate GitHub Login**

   - Click on **"Login with GitHub"**.
   - **OAuth Proxy Flow:**
     - A popup should appear directing you to `https://decap.your-domain.com/auth`.
     - Youâ€™ll be redirected to GitHubâ€™s OAuth authorization page.

3. **Authorize the Application**

   - Log in to GitHub (if not already logged in).
   - Authorize the OAuth application to access your repository with the required scopes.

4. **Complete the Authentication**

   - After authorization, you should be redirected back to `https://decap.your-domain.com/callback` where the OAuth proxy exchanges the code for an access token and communicates it back to Decap CMS.
   - The popup should close automatically, and you should now have access to the CMS interface.

5. **Verify CMS Functionality**
   - Try creating or editing a page to ensure that Decap CMS can commit changes to your GitHub repository.
   - Check your GitHub repo to confirm that the changes reflect correctly.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during setup, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

### a. "Repo Not Found" Error

- **Possible Causes:**

  - Incorrect `repo` field in `public/admin/config.yml`.
  - OAuth token lacks necessary permissions. Line 30 in `decap-proxy/src/index.ts` is not set to `'repo'` for private repositories.

- **Solutions:**

  1. **Verify Repository Details:**

     - Ensure the `repo` field follows the format `username/repo-name`.
     - Double-check spelling and case sensitivity.

  2. **Check OAuth Scopes:**

     - Ensure the OAuth flow requests the `repo` scope for private repositories.
     - Confirm that the OAuth token has the `repo` permission.

  3. **User Permissions:**
     - Ensure the GitHub user authenticating has access to the private repository.
     - If the repo is within an organization, ensure the OAuth app has access to the organization's repositories.

### b. "Client ID Undefined" Error

- **Cause:**  
  The GitHub OAuth Client ID is not correctly set in the environment variables.

- **Solution:**

  1. **Verify Environment Variable Names:**

     - Ensure that in Cloudflare Workers settings, the variables are named exactly as referenced in the worker code (`GITHUB_OAUTH_ID` and `GITHUB_OAUTH_SECRET`).

  2. **Redeploy the Worker:**
     - After setting or correcting environment variables, redeploy the worker to apply changes:
       ```bash
       npm run deploy
       ```

### c. Authentication Flow Issues

- **Symptoms:**

  - Popup does not close automatically.
  - Unable to access CMS after login.

- **Solutions:**

  1. **Check OAuth Callback Logic:**

     - Ensure the worker's callback script correctly sends the token back to Decap CMS and closes the popup.

  2. **Browser Console Errors:**

     - Open developer tools in your browser and check for any JavaScript errors or failed network requests during the authentication process.

  3. **Popup Blockers:**
     - Ensure that your browser is not blocking popups from your site.

### d. Cloudflare Zero Trust Issues

- **Symptoms:**

  - Unable to access `/admin` even after authentication.

- **Solutions:**

  1. **Review Access Policies:**

     - Ensure that your Zero Trust policies correctly include the users who should have access.

  2. **Check DNS Settings:**

     - Ensure that `decap.your-domain.com` is correctly pointed in your DNS settings and that the worker is deployed properly.

  3. **Test Without Zero Trust:**
     - Temporarily disable Zero Trust to determine if itâ€™s the source of the issue. If access works without it, review your Zero Trust configuration.
